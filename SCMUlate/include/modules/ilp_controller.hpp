 * Potential hazards:
 * 
 * Read after read: Not a problem
 * COD R1, R2, R3 (W, R, R)
 * COD R4, R2, R5 (W, R, R) // R2 is read again.
 * Here we don't need to do anything since R2 will not be changed. 
 * The two operations can be scheduled at the same time
 * 
 * Write after read: You cannot write because it is needed for a read.
 * COD R1, R2, R3 (W, R, R)
 * COD R2, R4, R5 (W, R, R) // R2 is going to be overwritten
 * We have to wait until R2 is consumed. However, in the origina tomasulo's
 * algorithm the value of R2 is copied in the reservation table, freeing the 
 * register R2 to be written. In our implementation we need to halt the second
 * instruction, marking the register busy, since we do not allow yet to have a 
 * copy of the operand in the reservation table. This would be costly as we are 
 * relying on whole copies to the register which go all the way to DRAM. 
 * Instead a register renaming scheme would solve this issue
 * 
 * 
 * Write after write: You cannot write until the first write is done.
 * COD R1, R2, R3 (W, R, R)
 * COD R1, R4, R5 (W, R, R) // R1 is going to be overwritten
 * We have to wait until the first instruction is executed.
 * Similar things happen in the write after read case. 
 * 
 * Read after write: You cannot read until the write happens. 
 * COD R1, R2, R3 (W, R, R)
 * COD R4, R1, R5 (W, R, R) // R1 needs to be produced first
 * This is the real dependency and we will have to wait until the first one is 
 * finished. 
 * 
 * In general the easy scheduling algorithm will do this:
 * 1. Mark all the registers as busy. For mem operations check memory overlapping. 
 * 2. If all the registers that are read operands are not busy then we start executing the operation.
 * 3. If we are missing a register, we stall the execution.
 * 
 * Memory operations are a little harder because we are required to check if the destination address is being op on
 * The next step is to implement register renaming which will eliminate false dependencies
 * And we should only stall if it is a true dependency.
 * 
 * After this, attempting to implement a version based on the tomasulo's algorithm
 * would be ideal. The trick is to somehow build the dep tree during execution. 
 * A big question is what to do with loops.

   * 
   * The state of a register is determined by three values: 
   *  -> Used:         This specifies if the register is busy. It may be read, write or none. When writting, there
   *                   is only a single instruction "owning" the register. When read, there may be multiple 
   *                   instructions reading from it. When none, there are no owners and it can be used.
   *  -> Rename:       Determines that any further reading references to that register must refer to another register.
   *                   If this value is not set (nullptr or "") there is no renaming. Depending on the upcoming instruction
   *                   this value can be re-set to none.
   *  -> Subscribers:  Determines the list of instructions which operands must be updated to available, once the data
   *                   in the register is written. When a register is currently in write state (used), readers must wait
   *                   for the data to be available (Sid's thesis could change this behavior). Once the reader has finished
   *                   producing the value, all the operands in the subscribers list are updated to full.
   *  -> broadcast:    When a readwrite operation occurs on a register, one must be careful to keep both dependencies. Since 
   *                   we do not have a value broadcasting mechanism (i.e. tomasulo's bus), we must copy the value "manually"
   *                   from one register to the other. This occurs so the RW operand can be written while other instructions read from the same
   *                   location. For example: 
   *                    1. Read R
   *                    2. Read R
   *                    3. Read R
   *                    4. ReadWrite R
   *                   in this case, in order for instruction 4 to begin it must wait for other instructions 1-3, otherwise, the write 
   *                   operation will change the values read by 1-3. What we do is we assign a new register to 4 (renaming) and then broadcast
   *                   the value from R to R'. This means. Copy the value from R to R'. Then R' can be freely modified.
   *                   It is possible to avoid broadcasting (save copy time), when there are no subscribers to a given register. For example
   *                    1. Write R
   *                    2. Readwrite R
   *                   In this case the value of R does not need to be saved for any reads. Therefore, we can bypass the broadcasting and
   *                   leave the original reference to R in the other op. 
   *                   There is a third case that must be considered. When two consecutive readwrites occur (with or without intermediate values)
   *                    1. Write R
   *                    2. ReadWrite R
   *                    3. ReadWrite R
   *                    4. Read R
   *                    5. Read R
   *                    6. ReadWrite R
   *                   In this case one must be careful not to broadcast the original write incorrecty. The order in which the broadcast are
   *                   registered is important. While 1 is happening 2 is issued. When analyzing 2, a broadcast operation on R is registered, 
   *                   but no renaming occurs (bypassed broadcastig). In this case when 1 is finished R will not be set to read, insteaad, it is
   *                   kept in write while 2 is enabled. If 3 is analyzed before 1 finishes, 3 will realize that it can bypass the broadcast
   *                   however, the broadcast must occur from 2 (the dependency between 2 and 3 must be kept). Therefore, the broadcast list after
   *                   3 is analyzed (and 1 has not finished) is ([inst2, op1(R)],[inst3,op1(R)]). Broadcasting must stop after the first broadcast.
   *                   For the case of instruction 6, the subscribed instructions 4 and 5 will force renaming. Broadcasting will be on register R'.
   *                   The list of broadcasting after 6 is issued (and 1 has not finished) is ([inst2, op1(R)],[inst3, Op1(R)],[inst6, op1(R')]). While the 
   *                   subscribers of R will be ([inst4, op1(R)], [inst5, op1(R)])
   *                   ()
   * 
   *  Allowing scheduling means to change the empty_full bit to full. Once all operands have their operands full, the instruction state
   *  is changed to READY
   * 
   * When the instruction is finished, the following table determines the actions to take
   * 
   * +-------------+---------+------------------------------+
   * | register is | used is | Result                       |

   * Structural hazzards:
   * ====================
   * 
   * When attempting register renaming there is a chance that no register can be reserved. This is,
   * the register file is completely full for that given size. When this happens it is an structural
   * hazzard and it can only be resolved if finished instructions are processed. However, the SU (who calls
   * checMarkInstructionsToSched) is also the one that handles instruction completion. therefore we must return
   * control flow to the caller, before trying to resolve the hazzard.
   * 
   * To do this we keep the instruction state, set it as hazzardous, and we keep the current operand number;   
   * The operand number is kept to avoid re-evaluating previous operands that have already been added to the 
   * other data structures (have already been processed). On re-entry to checkMarkInstructionsToSched, we check
   * if there is a previous hazzard, and we ignore current instruction in favor of resolving the hazzard.
