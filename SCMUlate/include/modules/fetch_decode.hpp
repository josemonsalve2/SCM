/** \brief Fetch decode module 
 *
 * This file contains the definition of the fetch_decode module that is used to 
 * obtain instructions from the instruction memory and pass them to the corresponding
 * execution unit or memory. 
 * 
 * The fetch decode is the equivalent of the Scheduling Unit. However, it uses the ilp unit
 * to make decisions on what is ready and can be scheduled. Furthermore, it uses the instruction_buffer
 * as the scheduling window. The instructions state in the scheduling window determines what 
 * can or cannot be executed. 
 * 
 * Since there are no backward dependencies in the dataflow graph that is formed in the buffer
 * there is no risk of deadlock. The instructions that are executing will eventually liberate any 
 * data dependencies on the instructions that are waiting. 
 * 
 * The algorithm should have this order:
 * The instruction buffer must be cleaned. Cleaning will change the position numbers in the
 *     queue, do not rely on the possition for ILP
 * The instruction buffer is filled with a new instruction.
 * The instruction is passed through the IPL controller to determine the next state
 * The buffer is traversed for instructions that are ready. When an instruction is
 *     ready there is some cleaning that needs to be done. These will be handled by the ILP
 *     controlle
 * The instrucion that is done requires to handle some bookkeping to change the state of 
 *     other instructions. Then the instruction can be set for decomissioning. 
 * The process starts over.
